# Kendel Circle Web App
## Disclaimer
This code is no bueno. I made this in a day. I am not proud of this, but it works for what I needed it to work for. Check out [the YouTube video about the creation of this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiXy9zEm8FA).

## Overview
This is the web app that would be most comparable to the website you see at jackbox.tv. People usually use this on their phones.

## Tech Overview
This is a React app made using create-react-app to maximize speed. All of the relevant code lives in App.jsx and Socket.js.

## How to run
You need Node/npm to use this.

Run `npm run start` to start the web server.
